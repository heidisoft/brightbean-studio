"""Django Ninja bearer-token auth class for the Agent API.

Resolves an ``Authorization: Bearer bb_studio_…`` header to an active
``ApiKey``, then duck-types a ``request.workspace_membership`` shim so the
existing ``@require_permission`` decorator from
``apps.members.decorators`` works unchanged when called from within a
Ninja route — same protocol (``effective_permissions`` dict), no DB rows
created, no signals fired.

Defense-in-depth checks on every request:

* HMAC compare on the secret part (constant-time)
* Key not revoked, not expired
* Issuer still has a ``WorkspaceMembership`` in the key's workspace
* Per-request permission intersection of (key.permissions) ∩
  (issuer's current effective workspace permissions) — silently shrinks
  the key's grants if the issuer is demoted, with no scheduled job
* Per-IP failed-auth throttle on the 401 path (brute-force defense on
  the ``lookup_prefix`` + secret)

We deliberately keep the shim cheap (one dataclass instance, no save())
and never write a synthetic ``WorkspaceMembership`` row.
